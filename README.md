### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Administrator with over 12 years experience in the MSP and Internal IT world. I also have some development experience in C#, PHP, SQL/NoSQL Databases, and NodeJS. At this point in my career, I currently have a heavy focus on automation of common tasks using tools like Go and PowerShell. I enjoy sharing all the bits of knowledge I have found or learned over my time. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and GIS analytics and furthering knowledge in PowerShell.
