### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am an IT Systems Engineer with over 15 years experience in the Consulting, Managed Services, and Internal IT world. 

I have yet to find a programming language that I don't like, but I mostly use PHP, JavaScript, and Python due to the nature of my work. I enjoy sharing all the bits of knowledge I have found or learned over my time.
