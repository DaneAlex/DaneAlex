### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an IT Systems Engineer with over 15 years experience in the MSP and Internal IT world. 

I have yet to find a programming language that I don't like, but I mostly use Python, Golang, PHP, and JavaScript due to the nature of my work. I enjoy sharing all the bits of knowledge I have found or learned over my time. 

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently building some things I can't share, yet.
